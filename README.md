# Dependency Picklist

This component can be used to do a Dependency Picklist from custom metadata.


## USE CASE

Sometimes we need to customize standard dependency picklist Salesforce to use custom logic for some reasons, standard picklist values limit, standard dependency limit, or more...So I created this component to solve this problem, using custom LWC and Custom metadata.

You can modify and adjust according to your needs.

## Next Updates

[] Add prints in readME to explain more about component works

[] Apply Some Design patterns to standardized to back and front (We have code smells here)

[] Dynamic picklist values and dependency
