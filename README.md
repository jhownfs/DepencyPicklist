# Dependency Picklist

This component can be used to do Dependency Picklist from custom metadata.


## USE CASE

Sometimes we need customize standard dependency picklist Salesforce to using a custom logic for some reasons, standard picklist values limit, standard dependency limit or more..So I created this component to solve this problem, using custom LWC and Custom metadata.

You can modify and adjust according your needs.

## Next Updates

[] Apply Some Design pattern to standarize
[] Dynamic picklist values and dependency
